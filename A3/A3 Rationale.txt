Rationale
Asymmetric Key Generation
We used 2048 bits RSA to generate the private keys separately for Alice and Bob
Then we generate the corresponding public keys.

We are using openssl rsa with OAEP padding because it’s non-malleable, as mentioned in the writeup, so even if the Delov-Yao gets the message later on and just modifies some bits, the rsa decryption won’t be undetectable. 

We choose des3 to encrypt the private key before outputting it because 
We choose 2048 bits because

Protocol narration
1. A->M: B, tA, Enc(A, kAB; K_B), Sign(B, tA, Enc(A, kAB; K_B); k_A)
2. M: if M forwards the exact secure channel message to B
	M->B: B, tA, Enc(A, kAB; K_B), Sign(B, tA, Enc(A, kAB; K_B); k_A)
